# ocaml-boolean-satisfiability
Implement a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver in OCaml.  This program takes in an input string  representing  a  Boolean  formula.   This  formula  may  involve  constants  (TRUE and FALSE)  and variables  (represented  by  lowercase  letters a through z).   Each  variable  may  be  either TRUE or FALSE.  The program should return a list of variable assignments that make the formula true.  For instance, to make (and a b) true, both “a” and “b” need to be TRUE. To make (or a b) true, there are three possible solutions, both “a” and “b” are TRUE, or “a” is TRUE, “b” is FALSE, or “b” is TRUE, “a” is FALSE.
